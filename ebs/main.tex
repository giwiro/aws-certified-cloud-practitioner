\section{EBS}\label{sec:ebs}

\subsection{What is}\label{subsec:what-is-ebs}
EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive that can be attached to a EC2 while they run.
EBS can only be \textbf{assigned to one EC2 at a time}, it is bound to a \textbf{specific availability zone}, and it has a provisioned capacity in GBs and IOPS\@.

\subsection{EBS Snapshots}\label{subsec:ebs-snapshots}
Snapshots are \textbf{backups an EBS Volume at a point in time}, and can be copied across regions/AZ. Since you cannot move an EBS across regions/AZ, you can create a Snapshot in the region, and then create a new EBS from the snapshot in the desired region/AZ.

\subsection{AMI}\label{subsec:ami}
It stands for Amazon Machine Image and are a \textbf{customization} of an EC2 instance (With additional software, config, OS, etc).
TYou can launch EC2 instances from:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Public AMI (AWS provided)}
		\item{Your own AMI (maintained by you development team}
		\item{AWS Marketplace AMI (Someone else's AMI)}
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{EC2 Instance Store}\label{subsec:ec2-instance-store}
\textbf{Ephemeral storage} (Data is lost upon deletion) that is located in the same physical location of the EC2 instance and provides a \textbf{better I/O performance}.
It's good for buffering and caching, but it's \textbf{more expensive}.

\subsection{EFS}\label{subsec:efs}
Managed NFS (network file system) that \textbf{can be bonded to multiple EC2 across multiple AZ}.
It is \textbf{HA, scalable and very expensive}.
